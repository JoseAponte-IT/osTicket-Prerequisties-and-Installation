# osTicket Prerequisites and Installation
This project demonstrates the process of setting up a ticketing system from scratch using osTicket on a Windows 10 virtual machine (VM) in Azure, showcasing technical proficiency in VM management, web server configuration, and PHP/MySQL integration. Follow along as I walk through each step, including the creation of the VM, installation of necessary software, and configuration of services, to set up a fully functional osTicket system. ðŸ«¡

<h2>Tools & Technology Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure 

- Virtual Machines

- RDP

- Internet Information Services [IIS]

- MySQL

<h2>Key Objectives:</h2>

- Azure Resource Management:
  - Created and configured Resource Groups, Virtual Networks, and Subnets.<br>
  - Deployed Virtual Machines with custom configurations.<br>
  - Configured Azure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control inbound and outbound traffic.

- Network Traffic Analysis:
   - Used Wireshark to capture and analyze network packets between two Virtual Machines.<br>
   - Simulated network traffic with PowerShell commands, including:<br>
     - ping -t to analyze ICMP traffic.<br>
     - SSH for port 22 traffic.<br>
     - RDP for port 3389 traffic.<br>
     - nslookup for DNS traffic (port 53).<br>
     - ipconfig /renew to monitor DHCP traffic on ports 67 and 68.

- Security Enhancements:<br>
  - Configured NSGs to selectively allow or deny specific types of traffic, ensuring secure      communication across the network.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

- An active Microsoft Azure Subscription

- Installation files [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1APMfNyfNzcxZC6EzdaNfdZsUwxWYChf6)

- Microsoft RDP: If on MAC go to APP Store and download Microsoft RDP

# Project Overview
<h2>Step 1: Create a Resource Group</h2>

<p align="center">
Navigate to Microsoft Azure and create a resource group: <br/>

<br />
<br />
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/WDCHbEa.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Once my resource group is created, next I'll create the virtual machine:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Setting up the virtual machine:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
<img src="https://imgur.com/QvyoJhd.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
I'll leave all other settings to default and create this VM. Once it has been created I'll use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to the VM:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/E9lD900.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Once I've connected to the VM I will install and enable IIS (Internet Information Servies) by going to Control Panel> Programs> Turn Windows Features On or Off> Internet Information Services and enable it then World Wide Web Services> Application Development Features and enable CGI:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/0MyNsKC.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Then go to Common HTTP Features dropdown and enable all features. Then apply the changes:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
I can test that the web server installed correctly by typing in the loopback IP (127.0.0.1) in the internet browser and this page should load:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/XdKGpGl.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now I need to install PHP manager for IIS Setup:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/RuAUGw1.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Install IIS URL Rewrite Module:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/465p9DH.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Once those have installed I will create a PHP directory on the C drive:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/CEsoJp6.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Now I'll download PHP and extract the zip file in the PHP directory I just made:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/LoYw0cZ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Download Microsoft Visual C++:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/SocF97p.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Download MySQL:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/dFdQagT.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Next, I have to setup the login credentials and I'll write them down just so I remember, since this is only a project. Do not write passwords down in real life:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/SeJVW6M.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Open IIS as an admin:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/gFmrka6.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Next go to PHP Manager> Register new PHP version and then select the file shown:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/nlD4F1L.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Go back to osticketVM Home and hit Restart under Manage Server on the right side:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/F83Qw2a.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Next I'll download osTicket and copy the upload file to the wwwroot file in the inetpub directory:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/op4Cs2g.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Rename upload file to osTicket:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/ZBLsJsB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Reload IIS and restart the server as I did before, then click Browse *80 (http) on the right side:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/JnqQOJD.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
This page should open:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/J4E020x.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Notice some extensions are not enabled. I'll enable a few of those in IIS. Go to Sites> Default Web Site> osTicket Click PHP Manager> Enable or disable an extension. Enable php_imap.dll, php_intl.dll, and php_opcache.dll:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/ZJCdcDV.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Note the changes here:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/yZbaGml.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Next browse in file explorer to C drive> osTicket> include> ost-sampleconfig.php and remove the "sample" from the name:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/k6cfJaY.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Right-click on ost-config.php> Properties> Security> Advanced> Disable Inheritance> Remove all inherited permissions from this object:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/G154DIx.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Click on the add buton to add permissions to the file> Select a principle> type "everyone"> Check> OK> check all permissions> OK> apply> OK:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/clvmCHq.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Hit continue on the osTicket web page in the browser and fill out the set up page:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/dYLO5Ot.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
Before database set up we'll have to connect the database using HeidiSQL. Install HeidiSQL from setup links:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/tyyovzJ.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
In HeidiSQL click New> Username = root> Password = mySQL password from mySQL setup> Open:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/xoW0TMX.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>
<br />
<br />
In HeidiSQL right click Unnamed> Create> New Database> Name it osTicket> OK. Then continue to fill out the database portion of osTicket setup. Click Install Now when done.:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Last steps, for clean up go to C drive> inetpub> wwwroot> osTicket and look for the setup file and delete it. Then go to C drive> inetpub> wwwroot> osTicket> include right click on ost-config.php> Properties> Security> Advanced> Select Everyone and click edit> only leave Read & Execute and Read checked, then apply settings:  <br/>
