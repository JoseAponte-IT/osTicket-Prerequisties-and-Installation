<h2>Step 4: Install and enable IIS wtih CGI (Internet Information Services| Windows web server ) </h2>

- Navigate to to the Control Panel -> Programs -> Turn Windows Features On or Off -> Internet Information Services

- Now Enable CGI: World Wide Web Services -> Application Development -> CGI 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef0e4a86-1e22-4d5f-abf0-5124d2968245)

- ðŸŽ‰ Awesome! By enabling IIS, you can now host web applications directly on your machine. Enabling CGI takes it a step further, allowing your web app to dynamically adapt based on user interactions and database inputs. This sets the stage perfectly for the mighty ticketing system to establish its roots!

<H2>Step 5: Enable all Common HTTP Features  (Virtual Machine)</H2>  

- Navigate to the Common HTTP Features and enable all features. Then apply the changes

<H2>Step 7: Set up PHP </H2>

- Install PHP manager for IIS Setup:  <br/>
<img src="https://imgur.com/RuAUGw1.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>

- This sets up PHP, the language responsible with communnicating with the database,formating and displaying that data for us. This means that PHP is responsible for keepign track of the tickets, permissions etc. A.K.A its really important   

- Install IIS URL Rewrite Module:  

<img src="https://imgur.com/465p9DH.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Setting Up in Azure"/>

- Create a PHP directory on the C drive
